# Scavenger
Scavenger is a tool to scrape 3rd party websites such as Ebay for deals on specific items. Developed primarily with Python.

TO INSTALL:
  Scavenger is currently a WIP project, meaning direct installation isn't available yet. This will be remedied soon.
  Required dependencies are as follows:
    Selenium
    Pyshorteners
    Pandas

USAGE:
  Scavenger, to soon be hosted online, is a program to intake a product name to then search on different reseller websites, such as 
  Ebay or Craigslist, to then output the data into an excel spreadsheet for the user to download.

TODO:
  Functionality as a terminal program was a success, now sights are set higher. Program will be hosted online for greater access to
  users. Web based access with Flask will greatly improve the user experience and remove the headache with installing a program for such a niche use.
