# Scavenger
Rule of Acquisition #9: Opportunity plus instinct equals profit! A tool to scrape 3rd party websites such as Ebay for deals on specific items. Developed primarily with Python.

TO INSTALL:
  Scavenger is currently a WIP project, meaning direct installation isn't available yet. This will be remedied soon.
  Required dependencies are as follows:
    Selenium
    Pyshorteners
    Pandas

USAGE:
  Scavenger is a terminal based program and will continue to be in the future. The user first inputs their desired search term.
  Then, the program asks for which site to search on (currently only Ebay).
  After, it asks for website specific search options, this being ebay, you may choose what sorting to use (Price and Shipping: Lowest First etc.).
  It will then save all current page prices into a CSV file for you to browse.

TODO:
  Currently, basic functionality is achieved but could greatly be improved. Some formats of Ebay's layout break the scrape functionality of the 
  program. Improving this program further and expanding onto Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace should be immensely easier with the practice
  I've had. With more time free from College, I should be able to develop more frequently soon.
